## Post 5/11: 📊 CORRELATION ANALYSIS: How ETF News Moved $SOL Price

Looking at past ETF milestones:

VanEck Filing (June 2024): -11.7% in 30 days
CME Futures Launch (Feb 2025): -39.3% 
SEC S-1 Request (June 2025): -13.2%

## Post 6/11: 🌟 WHY $SOL ETF > BITCOIN ETF (Controversial Take)

Bitcoin ETF inflows: $70B+ in first year
Expected $SOL ETF inflows: $2.7B - $5.2B initially

BUT here's why $SOL wins:

📈 Smaller market cap = higher % impact
🏗️ Growing ecosystem (DeFi, NFTs, memecoins)
💎 7% staking yield vs Bitcoin's 0%
⚡ 1,000x faster transactions
🔥 Deflationary tokenomics

$SOL = Bitcoin's moonshot potential at a fraction of the size

📊 95% approval odds
🎯 Multi-hundred percent upside potential
